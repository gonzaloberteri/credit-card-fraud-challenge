Financial Audit Trail System Design
Exercise
Project Overview
Design and implement a simplified Financial Transaction Audit System that demonstrates your
approach to tracking and analyzing financial transactions. This exercise evaluates both your
implementation skills and system design thinking in the context of financial auditing.
Requirements
Part 1: Core Application (Choose 2-3 features to implement)
Build a focused application that demonstrates your approach to financial auditing. Select 2-3
features from this list to implement:
● Transaction logging system with basic search/filter functionality
● Simple dashboard visualizing transaction patterns or anomalies
● User authentication with basic role separation (auditor vs. regular user)
● Transaction flagging/annotation system for audit review
● Basic reporting capability for filtered transactions
Part 2: System Design Document (Required)
Write a 1-2 page document explaining:
● Your architecture and key technical decisions
● Database design with focus on data integrity considerations
● Security approach for handling sensitive financial data
● How your system addresses basic audit requirements
● What tradeoffs you made given the time constraints
Part 3: Extension Discussion (Choose 1 question)
Briefly address one of the following:
1. How would you enhance this system to ensure regulatory compliance?
2. What approach would you take to implement basic anomaly detection?
3. How would you modify your design to ensure tamper-proof audit records?
Technology Choices
You're free to use any technologies you're comfortable with. The focus is on your approach
rather than specific technology implementations.
Time Constraint
This exercise is designed to be completed within 24 hours. We understand this is a tight
timeframe - focus on demonstrating your thinking rather than building a complete solution.
Evaluation Criteria
● Functionality: Does your chosen subset of features work effectively?
● Design Thinking: How well have you considered audit-specific requirements?
● Code Quality: Is your implementation clear and maintainable?
● Security Awareness: Have you addressed basic security concerns for financial data?
● Communication: How clearly can you explain your design decisions?
Submission Guidelines
● GitHub repository with your code
● Loom 2 min demo
● Loom 10 min explainer
